# TheBlackParrot's Streaming Overlays
...yeah I couldn't come up with a name.

----

This is my own personal streaming overlay suite that I allow anyone else to use, either by using [the instance I host](https://theblackparrot.me/overlays), or by self-hosting it. It is designed with self-hosting as a priority.
